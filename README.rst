A library for the calculation of hafnians, Hermite polynomials and Gaussian boson sampling. For more information, please see the `documentation <https://the-walrus.readthedocs.io>`_.

Features
========

* Fast calculation of hafnians, loop hafnians, and torontonians of general and certain structured matrices.

* An easy to use interface to use the loop hafnian for Gaussian quantum state calculations.

* Sampling algorithms for hafnian and torontonians of graphs.

* Efficient classical methods for approximating the hafnian of non-negative matrices.

* Easy to use implementations of the multidimensional Hermite polynomials, which can also be used to calculate hafnians of all reductions of a given matrix.


Installation
============

Pre-built binary wheels are available for the following platforms:

+------------+-------------+------------------+---------------+
|            | macOS 10.6+ | manylinux x86_64 | Windows 64bit |
+============+=============+==================+===============+
| Python 3.7 |      X      |        X         |       X       |
+------------+-------------+------------------+---------------+
| Python 3.8 |      X      |        X         |       X       |
+------------+-------------+------------------+---------------+
| Python 3.9 |      X      |        X         |       X       |
+------------+-------------+------------------+---------------+

To install, simply run

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install thewalrus


Compiling from source
=====================

The Walrus depends on the following Python packages:

* `Python <http://python.org/>`_ >= 3.7
* `NumPy <http://numpy.org/>`_  >= 1.13.3
* `Numba <https://numba.pydata.org/>`_ >= 0.43.1

In addition, to compile the C++ extension, the following dependencies are required:

* A C++11 compiler, such as ``g++`` >= 4.8.1, ``clang`` >= 3.3, ``MSVC`` >= 14.0/2015
* `Cython <https://cython.org/>`_ an optimising static compiler for the Python programming language.

On Debian-based systems, these can be installed via ``apt`` and ``curl``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo apt install g++
    $ pip install Cython

or using Homebrew on MacOS:

.. code-block:: console

    $ brew install gcc
    $ pip install Cython

You can compile the latest development version by cloning the git repository, and installing using pip in development mode.

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus.git
    $ cd thewalrus && python -m pip install -e .


OpenMP
------

``libwalrus`` uses OpenMP to parallelize both the permanent and the hafnian calculation. **At the moment, this is only supported on Linux/MacOS using the GNU g++ compiler/Clang.**



Software tests
==============

To ensure that The Walrus library is working correctly after installation, the test suite can be run by navigating to the source code folder and running

.. code-block:: console

    $ make test

To run the low-level C++ test suite, `Googletest <https://github.com/google/googletest>`_
will need to be installed. In Ubuntu-based distributions, this can be done as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo apt-get install cmake libgtest-dev

Alternatively, the latest Googletest release can be installed from source:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo apt install cmake
    wget -qO - https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/release-1.8.1.tar.gz | tar -xz
    cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$HOME/googletest -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release googletest-release-1.8.1
    make install

If installing Googletest from source, make sure that the included headers and
libraries are available on your include/library paths.

Documentation
=============

The Walrus documentation is available online on `Read the Docs <https://the-walrus.readthedocs.io>`_.

To build it locally, you need to have the following packages installed:

* `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ >= 1.5
* `sphinxcontrib-bibtex <https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ >= 0.3.6
* `nbsphinx <https://github.com/spatialaudio/nbsphinx>`_
* `Pandoc <https://pandoc.org/>`_
* `breathe <https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ >= 4.12.0
* `exhale <https://exhale.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
* `Doxygen <http://www.doxygen.nl/>`_

They can be installed via a combination of ``pip`` and ``apt`` if on a Debian-based system:
::

    $ sudo apt install pandoc doxygen
    $ pip3 install sphinx sphinxcontrib-bibtex nbsphinx breathe exhale

To build the HTML documentation, go to the top-level directory and run the command

.. code-block:: console

    $ make doc

The documentation can then be found in the ``docs/_build/html/`` directory.

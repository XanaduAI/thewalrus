The Walrus
==========

.. currentmodule:: thewalrus

This is the top level module of the The Walrus, containing functions for
computing the hafnian, loop hafnian, and torontonian of matrices.

Algorithm terminology
---------------------

Eigenvalue hafnian algorithm
    The algorithm described in
    *A faster hafnian formula for complex matrices and its benchmarking on a supercomputer*,
    :cite:`bjorklund2018faster`.
    This algorithm scales like :math:`\mathcal{O}(n^3 2^{n/2})`, and supports calculation of
    the loop hafnian.

Recursive hafnian algorithm
    The algorithm described in *Counting perfect matchings as fast as Ryser* :cite:`bjorklund2012counting`.
    This algorithm scales like :math:`\mathcal{O}(n^4 2^{n/2})`. This algorithm does not
    currently support the loop hafnian.

Repeated hafnian algorithm
    The algorithm described in *From moments of sum to moments of product*, :cite:`kan2008moments`.
    This method is more efficient for matrices with repeated rows and columns, and supports calculation of
    the loop hafnian.

Approximate hafnian algorithm
    The algorithm described in *Polynomial time algorithms to approximate permanents and mixed discriminants
    within a simply exponential factor*, :cite:`barvinok1999polynomial`.
    This algorithm allows us to efficiently approximate the hafnian of
    matrices with non-negative elements. This is done by sampling determinants;
    the larger the number of samples taken, the higher the accuracy.

Batched hafnian algorithm
    An algorithm that allows the calculation of hafnians of all reductions of
    a given matrix up to the cutoff (resolution) provided. Internally, this algorithm
    makes use of the multidimensional Hermite polynomials as per
    *The calculation of multidimensional Hermite polynomials and Gram-Charlier coefficients*
    :cite:`berkowitz1970calculation`.

Low-rank hafnian algorithm
    An algorithm that allows to calculate the hafnian of an :math:`r`-rank matrix :math:`\bm{A}` of size :math:`n \times n`
    by factorizing it as :math:`\bm{A} = \bm{G} \bm{G}^T` where :math:`\bm{G}` is of size :math:`n \times r`. The algorithm
    is described in Appendix C of
    *A faster hafnian formula for complex matrices and its benchmarking on a supercomputer*,
    :cite:`bjorklund2018faster`.

Banded hafnian algorithm
    An algorithm that calculates the hafnian of a matrix :math:`\bm{A}` of size :math:`n \times n` with bandwidth
    :math:`w` by calculating and storing certain subhafnians dictated by the bandwidth. The algorithm
    is described in Section V of
    *Efficient sampling from shallow Gaussian quantum-optical circuits with local interactions*,
    :cite:`qi2020efficient`.

Sparse hafnian algorithm
    An algorithm that calculates the hafnian of a sparse matrix by taking advantage of the Laplace expansion and memoization, to store
    only the relevant paths that contribute non-zero values to the final calculation.

These new polynomials improve the speed and accuracy of `thewalrus.quantum.state_vector` and `thewalrus.quantum.density_matrix` and also `hafnian_batched` and `hermite_multimensional` when called with the optional argument `renorm=True`. [#108](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus/pull/108)

* Reorganization of the repository structure; C++ source code folder has been renamed from `src` to `include`, C++ tests have been moved into their own top-level directory `tests`, and the `hafnian/lib` subpackage has been removed in favour of a top-level `thewalrus/libwalrus.so` module. [#34](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus/pull/34)

* Added additional references to the bibliography [#30](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus/pull/30)

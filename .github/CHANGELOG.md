# Version 0.16.0

### New features

* Adds the function `hafnian_sparse` to compute sparse loop hafnians (pure Python implementation). [#245](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus/pull/245)

* The ``symplectic.squeezing`` function is now generalized to multiple modes of single mode squeezing. [#249](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus/pull/249)

* Adds a function ``symplectic.passive_transformation`` which allows for Gaussian states to be transformed by arbitrary non-unitary, non-square linear optical transformations. [#249](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus/pull/249)

* The ``torontonian_sample_state`` function now can sample displaced Gaussian states. [#248](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus/pull/248)

* Adds the function `hafnian_banded` to calculate the hafnian of a banded matrix. [#246](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus/pull/246)

* Adds the functions `hermite_multidimensional_numba` and `grad_hermite_multidimensional_numba` to calculate renormalized multidimensional Hermite polynomials and its gradients using numba. [#251](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus/pull/251)

* Adds the functions `mzgate` and `grad_mzgate` to calculate the Fock representation of the Mach-Zehnder gate and its gradients. [#257](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus/pull/257)

* Adds the ability to calculate cumulants and arbitrary expectation values of products of powers of photon numbers with the functions `photon_number_cumulant` and `photon_number_moment` respectively. [#264](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus/pull/264)

* Adds support for calculating the permanent using the BBFG algorithm and changes this to the default method for calculating permanents. [#267](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus/pull/267)

* Adds the ability to calculate click cumulants in threshold detection with the function `click_cumulant`. [#264](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus/pull/274)

### Improvements

* Speeds up the calculation of photon number variances/covariances. [#244](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus/pull/244)

### Bug fixes

* Corrects bug in the function `photon_number_covar` that gave incorrect results when the covariance between two modes with finite displacements was calculated.
[#264](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus/pull/264)

### Breaking changes

* Torontonians and approximations to the hafnian for non-negative matrices are no longer calculated
  in C++ using the Eigen software library. Instead, they are now calculated in pure Python using
  Numba. These changes have the nice result of making The Walrus compilable from source using only a
  C++ compiler. [#262](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus/pull/262) [#259](https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus/pull/259).

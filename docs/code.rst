Overview

Python API
----------

* The :mod:`thewalrus` Python API provides access to various highly optimized hafnian, permanent, and torontonian algorithms

* The :mod:`thewalrus.quantum` submodule provides access to various utility functions that act on Gaussian quantum states

* The :mod:`thewalrus.samples` submodule provides access to algorithms to sample from the hafnian or the torontonian of Gaussian quantum states

* The :mod:`thewalrus.symplectic` submodule provides access to a convenient set of symplectic matrices and utility functions to manipulate them

* The :mod:`thewalrus.random` submodule provides access to random unitary, symplectic and covariance matrices

* The :mod:`thewalrus.fock_gradients` submodule provides access to the Fock representation of certain continuous-variable gates and their gradients

* The :mod:`thewalrus.reference` submodule provides access to pure-Python reference implementations of the hafnian, loop hafnian, and torontonian


Octave
------

In addition, two auxiallary Octave functions are provided: :download:`octave/hafnian.m <../octave/hafnian.m>` and :download:`octave/loophafnian.m <../octave/loophafnian.m>`.

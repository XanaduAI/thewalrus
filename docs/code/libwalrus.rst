.. _libwalrus_cpp:

The libwalrus C++ library
=========================

The ``libwalrus`` C++ library is provided as a header-only library, :download:`libwalrus.hpp <../../include/libwalrus.hpp>`, which can be included at the top of your source file:

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <libwalrus.hpp>

The following templated functions are then available for use within the ``libwalrus`` namespace.

Example
-------

For instance, consider the following example :download:`example.cpp <../../examples/example.cpp>`, which calculates the loop hafnian of several all ones matrices:

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <iostream>
    #include <complex>
    #include <vector>
    #include <libwalrus.hpp>


    int main() {
        int nmax = 10;

        for (int m = 1; m <= nmax; m++) {
            // create a 2m*2m all ones matrix
            int n = 2 * m;
            std::vector<std::complex<double>> mat(n * n, 1.0);

            // calculate the hafnian
            std::complex<double> hafval = libwalrus::loop_hafnian(mat);
            // print out the result
            std::cout << hafval << std::endl;
        }

        return 0;
    };

This can be compiled using the gcc ``g++`` compiler as follows,

.. code-block:: console

    $ g++ example.cpp -o example -std=c++11 -O3 -Wall -I/path/to/libwalrus.hpp -fopenmp

where ``/path/to/libwalrus.hpp`` is the path to the directory containing ``libwalrus.hpp`` and the ``-fopenmp`` flag instructs the compiler to parallelize the compiled program using OpenMP.

Below, the main interface (available as templated functions) as well as all auxiliary functions are summarized and listed.

.. note::

    If compiling using the ``clang`` compiler provided by Xcode on MacOS, OpenMP is natively supported, however the ``libomp.so`` library must be installed and linked to separately. One approach is to use the Homebrew packaging manager:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ brew install libomp
        $ clang example.cpp -o example -O3 -Wall -fPIC -shared -Xpreprocessor -fopenmp -lomp \
        -I/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/include/c++/v1/


Main interface
--------------

The following functions are intended as the main interface to the C++ ``libwalrus`` library. Most support parallelization via OpenMP.
